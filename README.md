# Rob's Script Repository 👨‍💻

Welcome to my personal (public) script stash! This is a treasure trove of scripts primarily tested and used with Level RMM but are flexible enough to be adapted to other RMM tools as well. Here, you'll find scripts that aim to simplify your life, automate mundane tasks, and enhance the performance of your machines or managed services. 🚀

## What's Inside? 📦

- **Automation Scripts:** Scripts to help you automate your tasks and save time.
- **Performance Enhancers:** Scripts designed to boost efficiency and performance.
- **Custom Solutions:** A variety of scripts that can be tailored to meet your unique needs.

## Getting Started 🌟

To get started:

1. Clone the repo to your local machine or download the scripts directly.
2. Read through the documentation/comments provided with each script to understand its purpose and how it works.
3. Customize the scripts as needed to fit into your workflow or environment.
4. Implement and enjoy the efficiency!

Note: These can all just be copied into your RMM of choice or used directly as a file for your machines locally/GPO/other distro method.
